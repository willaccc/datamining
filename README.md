# Data Mining

This repo includes important functions from book Data Mining: Concepts and Techniques by Jiawei Han, Micheline Kamber, and Jian Pei - 3rd edition. 

The goal for this repo is to use only the basic math package (numpy in this case) to achieve methods described in the book. Limited by knowledge and resource, some expanded methods were not included.
